# Building-with-Backgrounds-and-Gradients

This project consists of building a webpage using images as a background and adding gradients to elements. The goal is to make a clone of old an old version of the [Apple website webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

*Project number 4 of the HTML course on Microverse.*

I've used Flex, Sass and gradients for this project.
